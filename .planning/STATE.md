# Project state

## Current phase
1 — Coverage Planner Rewrite (planning complete, ready to execute — 9 plans across 5 waves)

## Resume point
- **Last completed step:** `/gsd-plan-phase 1 --auto` (verified, committed `cb464b10`)
- **Next step:** `/gsd-execute-phase 1 --auto` in a fresh conversation (`/clear` first)
- **Auto-chain flag persisted:** yes (`workflow._auto_chain_active=true` in `.planning/config.json`)
- **Wave 1 plans:** 01-01 (mowgli_interfaces extensions), 01-03 (mowgli_robot.yaml + CLAUDE.md invariants)
- **Wave 2 plans:** 01-02 (mowgli_geometry library), 01-04 (GUI integration)
- **Wave 3 plans:** 01-05 (coverage_planner skeleton), 01-06 (map_server cleanup)
- **Wave 4 plans:** 01-07 (planner core: validators + sweep + narrow strategies), 01-08 (BT integration)
- **Wave 5 plans:** 01-09 (E2E sim + Pi5 hardware smoke — operator-gated checkpoint)

## Active branch
`migrate/upstream-localization` (HEAD `c778e40c` at .planning bootstrap time)

## Locked architectural decisions

These were locked in chat on 2026-04-28 before `/gsd-spec-phase` started — the spec-phase interview must NOT re-litigate them, only refine details below them.

1. **New separate ROS2 node:** `coverage_planner_node` lives in a new package (or in `mowgli_map`), parallel to `map_server_node`. The legacy strip planner inside `map_server_node` keeps running until the new planner is hardware-verified.
2. **Action-based delivery:** `PlanCoverage.action` (rclcpp_action) — supports feedback during long planning, supports cancellation, supports resume.
3. **Sequential plan execution by BT:** the BT consumes the plan as a sequential `PoseStamped` waypoint list. Lokale dynamische Hindernisse werden via `collision_monitor` + Nav2 lokalem Planer umfahren — KEIN globales Replan.
4. **Iteration 1 = simple AABB sweep with obstacle clipping** (footprint-aware). No BCD in this phase.
5. **Robot footprint = rectangular 4-point polygon with `drive_axis_offset`** as the rotation centre. All collision checks use the footprint, not the tool plate.
6. **Checkpoint persistence = atomic YAML file** next to `mow_progress.png`, written at the end of each completed swath.

## Open milestones (parking lot)

- Localization migration Phase 3 (mag fusion, blocked by AltIMU-10v6 hardware) — separate from this rewrite.
- BCD upgrade for complex polygons — future phase, after Iteration 1 lands.
- LiDAR scan-match smart undock (#43 local tracker) — separate from this rewrite.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-28 | Bootstrap `.planning/` directly with this single phase, skip `/gsd-new-project` | Project context is already documented in CLAUDE.md + memory; full discovery would be overhead |
| 2026-04-28 | Six architectural decisions locked pre-spec (see above) | User explicitly answered all six in chat before invoking `/gsd-spec-phase` |
| 2026-04-28 | SPEC.md committed — 13 requirements locked, ambiguity 0.17 | `/gsd-spec-phase 1` end-to-end |
| 2026-04-28 | CONTEXT.md committed — 12 implementation decisions (D-01..D-12) + Claude's discretion items | `/gsd-discuss-phase 1 --chain` end-to-end; `--chain` triggers auto-advance to plan-phase |
| 2026-04-28 | D-05 supersedes SPEC R-10 wording on file format: key=value text instead of YAML | yaml-cpp deliberately avoided in stack (`hardware_bridge_node.cpp:99`); other R-10 acceptance bits (atomic, sidecar, full field set) preserved |
