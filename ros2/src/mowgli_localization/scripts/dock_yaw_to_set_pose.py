dock_yaw_to_set_pose.py

Bridges the dock-heading publication on /gnss/heading (sensor_msgs/Imu,
emitted by hardware_bridge_node every 1 s while is_charging is true) into a
one-shot set_pose on /ekf_map_node/set_pose for the robot_localization
backend.

Why:
  The global EKF (ekf_map_node) has no absolute heading reference at boot —
  the IMU has no magnetometer and navsat_transform only feeds position, not
  yaw. Without this bridge the filter yaw stays random until the robot has
  driven far enough for GPS position innovations (or /imu/cog_heading) to
  correct it indirectly.

Semantics:
  Fires once per docking event (rising edge of is_charging, plus one firing
  shortly after node start if the robot is already docked at boot). The
  emission does NOT repeat at 1 Hz — continuous set_pose while charging
  would keep snapping the filter back to the dock during the undock reverse
  motion. One shot is enough to give ekf_map a plausible yaw seed that
  CalibrateHeadingFromUndock then refines using the BackUp displacement.
